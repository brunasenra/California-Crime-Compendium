# California Crime Compendium: Comparing Campuses

In this notebook, we will use 8 Datasets from "California Crime and Law Enforcement employment data from 2015". 
These police and criminal statistics were provided by the FBI through the Kaggle Dataset. 
The eight datasets cross locations such as: law enforcement agencies, universities, cities and counties, with: 
law enforcement employees and crimes. We will merge them in those locations and analyze each one of them.
